# Script Execution

The Python scripts were executed using Bash wrappers to facilitate integration and job submission on our high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. 
* For reproducibility and reference, the associated Bash scripts are included in this section. 
* All of the python scripts are located in the `/via` directory inside the apptainer `.sif` file.
